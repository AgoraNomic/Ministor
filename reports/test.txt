Notices
=======

This is the first official Ministor's Report. Please be advised that I 
grant a Victory Card and Victory Points in a section below.

Economy Focused Players: There is a pending proposal (adJustments) that 
would change the economy pot from 50 coins to 50 boatloads of coins, 
which would increase the amount of the split (it is determined 
continuously). Consider waiting to grant yourself your coins until this 
proposal has been assessed.
