Notices
=======

This is the first official Ministor's Report. Please be advised that I 
grant a Victory Card and Victory Points in a section below.

Economy Focused Players: There is a pending proposal (adJustments) that 
would change the economy pot from 50 coins to 50 boatloads of coins, 
which would increase the amount of the split (it is determined 
continuously). Consider waiting to grant yourself your coins until this 
proposal has been assessed.

Player Ministry Focuses
=======================

Focus grants a monthly bonus:

* Unfocused - nothing, just the default
* Compliance - grant yourself a Justice card
* Legislation - grant yourself a Legislative card
* Participation - grant yourself a Voting card
* Economy - grant yourself a split of the coin pot (exact amount listed 
  below in its own section)
* Legacy - be granted a card or victory point, randomly (winner listed

You can Plan To Flip your own focus by announcement - it will be flipped
